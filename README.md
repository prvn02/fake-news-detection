Fake News Detection Project
Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fake news articles. The increasing prevalence of fake news has significant social and political implications, making this an important problem to address.

Project Structure
Introduction: Overview of the fake news problem and its significance.
Data Overview: Initial exploration of the datasets used for the project.
Data Preprocessing: Steps taken to clean and prepare the data for analysis and modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and analyses to uncover patterns and insights from the data.
Model Building: Development of machine learning models to classify news articles as true or fake.
Model Evaluation: Evaluation of model performance using various metrics.
Conclusion: Final insights, potential improvements, and conclusions.
Datasets
The project uses two datasets:

true_news: Contains true news articles with columns such as title, text, subject, and date.
fake_news: Contains fake news articles with similar columns.
